To Implement:
    Implement 32bits virtual space address system 
To Fix:
    Older machines may crash due to unalligned memory access
    Getting bytecode parameters is optimized for little endian processors
    
32 bit virtual memory implementation steps
1 - change compact function stack to word as min element size function stack
2 - implement objects structures and metadata
3 - implement virtual memory
